🧠 GoF Design Patterns – Simple Java Examples
This repository contains simple Java implementations of a few selected GoF (Gang of Four) design patterns. Each pattern is organized in its own folder for clarity and isolation.

⚠️ The goal of this project is not to provide a complete or exhaustive catalog of patterns.
It’s a personal review done some time ago, now shared with the community.


Each implementation is:

🔹 Self-contained in its own folder

🔹 Easy to read and understand

🔹 Runnable via a main class or simple entry point

🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/joseaugustolins/designpatternsjava.git
cd designpatternsjava.git
Open in your IDE of choice

Explore the folders and run the main classes to see the patterns in action
